# Quest Replay Converter

Allows you to convert replays recorded with older versions of the Oculus Quest Beat Saber replay mod to ones that can be
played back with the newer version. (the old version used an inefficient text format, this has now changed to a better, binary format)

## Usage

1. Download the compiled binary from the releases section.
2. Extract somewhere on your computer.
3. Using SideQuest, copy all replays (replays should be found in the ``sdcard/Android/data/com.beatgames.beatsaber/files/replays`` directory on your Quest.) with the old format into a folder called ``replays`` (in the same directory as the executable).
4. Run the program, and wait for it to finish. (this might take a while depending on your number of replays)
5. Your converted replays are in the ``converted`` directory, so you can put these back on to your Quest.
